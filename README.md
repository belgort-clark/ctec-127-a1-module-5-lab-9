# Module 7
## Lab Nos. 9 and 10

## Assignment Overview

This assignment counts for **two lab assignments**. In Canvas they will be identified as **Lab No. 9/10**.

This lab will have you refactor the **Temperature Converter** PHP code you submitted for **Lab 6** and have you create a version of the page that employs **Bootstrap 5** layout and design features.

[Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)

## Tasks that Must be Performed

### Task No. 1

You must include a Bootstrap navigation [navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/) at the top of the page. You must format the navbar to match the design of the rest of your page. Include some links in the navbar to 3 sites of your choice.

### Task No. 2

You must place the function code into a external file such as functions.inc.php. You must place the code in an **inc** folder.

Place as much code as you can into include files. This will help keep the lab9.php code easy to ready and understand.

### Task No. 3

You will be responsible for wiring the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript. Look at other code examples from this class in case you forgot how to do it. Heck, look a the CTEC 127 Template.

### Task No. 4

Include an area above the form that acts like a "hero" section. This will give the user info about your awesome temperature converter. Maybe use some images from Unsplash.

### Task No. 5

You must format all of the labels and form fields using Bootstrap styling.

You must format the select tags using Bootstrap classes as well.

You must format the button using Bootstrap button classes.

The form must be responsive and looks good at all of the Bootstrap breakpoints.

### Task No. 6

Below the form, place two columns that are each 6 columns wide that contain the formulas being used for the temperature conversions. Place the formulas in the left column and in the right column put some info about Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin temperatures. Be sure to also include a heading in each column.

### Task No. 7

Use any other Bootstrap assets that you want to make your page look great and work as expected.

**BE CREATIVE**

### Task No. 8

Create a short Loom video demonstrating your completed lab.

### Task No. 9
